 <p>I know we will have to maintain social distancing,so we can not visit our family.But we can talk to them without going near by them.Thanks to technology.Call your family member and friends talk to them.You can make video call and see face to face.Talk to people, it will relax you.What would you do if you were in 18th century? We could not talk to our family.So take advantage of technology.Instead of wasting your time in social media,use it on right place. </p>
